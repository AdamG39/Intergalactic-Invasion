# Intergalactic-Invasion

Simple 2D Space Invaders like game created using the Unity game engine. This game was created as part of a college exam and so it made in a limited time frame. The games difficulty (especially when fighting the boss) is quite unforgiving but I wasn't able to fix this issue in the time frame. There are a number of improvements to be made on this project however for the time being this project is finished and likely to never be revisited.

## How to play
